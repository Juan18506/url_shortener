This is a mini project that allows to act as a URL shortener (insert a shorthand in the URL path and be redirected to the URL linked to that shorthand),
the shorthands allowed are the fields "path" in a JSON file (you can select a new JSON file with ./web -json command) so if you want to add a new shorthand you only need to add a new path,url pair to the JSON selected.
Due to this you need restart the server when you want to change the content of the JSON file or the JSON file itself.
